# Project Title: Snake Game

## Description
This project is a simple Snake Game that I created by following a tutorial on the BroCode channel. The game is built using Java and utilizes the Java Swing library for the graphical interface. In this project, I have incorporated the Timer and Random classes. The Timer class is used to manage the game loop and update the screen at regular intervals, while the Random class is utilized to generate apples on the screen for the snake to eat.

## How to Run the Game
To run the game, navigate to the `out/artifact/SnakeGame/` directory and open the `MainGame.jar` file.

## What I Learned
While working on this project, I learned how to:
- Create a simple game using Java
- Implement game logic for the classic Snake Game
- Utilize the Java Swing library for graphical user interface
- Incorporate the Timer class to manage game updates
- Use the Random class to generate random elements in the game
